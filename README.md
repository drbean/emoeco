This is an academic project. The aim is to understand the use to
which emoji are put as contextualization cues (per Gumperz), the
way they ground the words in a context to convey a message. The results will be
presented as a thesis to a university. There will be no software published.

Sociolinguistic analysis of the emoji in the tweets as means of social
relationship management will be carried out as far as they affect the
performanace of speech acts, the content of messages and interactions, and the
procedures and styles participants adopt, but will not be used to develop
software.

> you’ll interact with Tw+tter accounts, or their content

There will be no interaction, except for the downloading of
tweets.

> If you’ll display Twitter content off of Twitter, explain how, and where,
> Tweets and Twitter co+tent will be displayed with your product or service,
> including whether Tweets and Twitter content + will be displayed at row level,
> or aggregated.

Small numbers of individual tweets may be displayed, suitably anonymized, in
the text of the thesis presented to the university, but will not otherwise be
published. Statistics of overall tendencies may also be included.
